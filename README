This is to play around with exporting Blender models to Haxe.

Based on code from Dennis Ippel at:
  http://www.rozengain.com/blog/2008/01/02/export-your-blender-objects-straight-to-away3d-papervision3d-and-sandy/
used under the GPL.

=======================================================================

Features:

* Works from export menu, or from command line.

* Can export test code to visualize the exported model.  The camera in
  Flash is placed as it is in Blender.

* For objects with a single UV image, that image will be automatically
  exported and used.

* Generates haxe project files (hxml) and example makefiles for Unix
  users.
