This is a utility for exporting Blender models to Haxe code.
All material is released under the GPL, see HXExport.py for details.

It is based on the AS3Export utility from Dennis Ippel:
  http://www.rozengain.com/blog/2008/01/02/export-your-blender-objects-straight-to-away3d-papervision3d-and-sandy/
Used under the GPL.

It also uses the jinja2 templating system, under a BSD license.

And ideaman's automatic UV unwrapping code is used in a lightly 
modified version (modified for use without a GUI).

An earlier version of this code was integrated with AS3Export.
This code is basically that patch gone wild and taking over everything.

=======================================================================
= INSTALLATION

Install this code in a directory called:
  .blender/scripts/blender2haxe
or
  .blender\scripts\blender2haxe
or whatever is appropriate for your operating system.

The utility will work best with the imagemagick "convert" utility in
your path, but it is not required.

The Haxe code generated uses the "sandy" library, so that needs to be
installed.  This can be done with:
  haxelib install sandy

=======================================================================
= USE

From Blender, select an object, and do:
  File->Export->Haxe class

You can also run the code from the command line, as follows:

  blender -b file.blend -P ~/.blender/scripts/blender2haxe/HXExport.py

=======================================================================
= FEATURES

* Works from export menu, or from command line.

* Can export test code to visualize the exported model.  The camera in
  Flash is placed as it is in Blender.

* For objects with a single UV image, that image will be automatically
  exported and used.

* Option included for generating a basic UV image for objects that
  don't have one.

* Generates haxe project files (hxml) and example makefiles for Unix
  users.
