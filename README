This is to play around with exporting Blender models to Haxe.

Based on code from Dennis Ippel at:
  http://www.rozengain.com/blog/2008/01/02/export-your-blender-objects-straight-to-away3d-papervision3d-and-sandy/
used under the GPL.  Dennis accepted a patch for outputting Haxe; this
code is basically that patch gone wild and taking over everything.

=======================================================================
= INSTALLATION
=

Install this code in:
  .blender/scripts/blender2haxe
or
  .blender\scripts\blender2haxe
or whatever is appropriate for your operating system.

Then from Blender, select an object, and do:
  File->Export->Haxe class

You can also run the code from the command line, as follows:

  blender -b file.blend -P ~/.blender/scripts/blender2haxe/HXExport.py

=======================================================================
= FEATURES
=

* Works from export menu, or from command line.

* Can export test code to visualize the exported model.  The camera in
  Flash is placed as it is in Blender.

* For objects with a single UV image, that image will be automatically
  exported and used.

* Generates haxe project files (hxml) and example makefiles for Unix
  users.
